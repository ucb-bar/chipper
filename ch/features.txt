=== Features of Chipper ===
"When" respects scope:
   Thus now you can now actually use generating functions within conditionals.
   
Constraint-Based Width Solver:
   This allows for operations (such as addition) to grow in width, without causing width inference to run forever.

Reset can be explicitly assigned and retrieved:
   Users can now route custom logic to the reset signal of instances.
   Users can also retrieve the reset signal of the current module and write a custom handler.

Registers can be partially initialized:
   Registers have an init field that can be fully or partially assigned.
